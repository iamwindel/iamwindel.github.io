                During my college graduation, my thesis was awarded “Best in Software Design”. My thesis in summary, is a multi-level marketing system, 
                wherein a person who refers another person and will get commissions base on the performance of their referrals. It was designed for a client 
                (referred by my professor) whose business was selling and referring people. My client bought my thesis and there it was, my first income in programming.
