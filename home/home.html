		        PROGRAMMING

		    <h5>
		        IS MY PASSION
		    </h5>
		    <p>
		        I started my programming career when I was in 3rd year high school. I, along with 2 of my schoolmates have represented our school Saint Francis of Assisi in the National Programming Competition high school division and continue to do the same in my 4th year high school. We did not win any of the two competitions, but the rigid training I have received was truly an amazing experience.
		    </p>  
		    <p>
		        In the present, I create web applications and databases for my employer. My goal in creating an application is to have positive user feedback. I want people to have a really good experience in using the application, not only the way it looks but more importantly the way it feels, the way the user actually experience it and relies on it. I believe that there is no other way to rate how good the application is but through the user experience.
		    </p> 
		    <p>
		        The web site I create must be available in browsers Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, and all other major browsers. I have to make my application cross-browser compatible because I want users to use their preferred browser. I make it responsive so that users can view it in their mobile phones, tablet, laptop and desktop computers. I use modern technology advantage like CDN to improve the speed performance of the application for my goal is for the user to have a positive experience in using the application.
		    </p> 
		    <p>
		        I truly am a pure hearted developer. I always felt that I have never let my life pass me by, because I am doing what I love to do. Since I always had the prerogative to do whatever excite me, I never felt forced to do anything, its just my natural habit performing automatically. I sincerely have the passion in programming.
